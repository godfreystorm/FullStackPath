    <br>
    <h2>What Happened</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:-1%;">Flesh out the story in more detail than intro with more background, information, and sources. Keep the first part of this section factual,

    <p style="margin-top: -1%;">Inserting your opinion might be a questionable move, so make sure you get the okay from appropiate stakeholders before publishing 
        opinions - particularly on sensitive news stories.</p>
    <h2>What's Happening Now/Next [Optional]</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: -1%;">If the story is still breaking, you may wnat to leave this blank. However, if the dust has settled and you have reliable information on what the 
        ripple effects of this news story will be, mention them here so readers know what to expect.</p>
